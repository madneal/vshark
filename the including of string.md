##  the including of string

### description

Given a long string a and a short string b. So, how to judge the a contains the short string b totallly. Please write a function `stringContain(a, b)` to implement this.

For simplicity,we assume that the string only contains capital characters. For example,

* Assume a is 'ABCD', b is 'BAD', the answer is true, as a contains all the characters of b, or we can say b is the true subset of a.
* Assume a is 'ABCD', and  b is 'BCE', the answer is false, as the character 'E' is not in the a.
* Assume a is 'ABCD', and b is 'AA', and the answer is true, because the character 'A' is in b.
